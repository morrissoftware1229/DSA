# DSA
Showcases my work on learning data structures and algorithms

## The Plan
I will be using the roadmap provided on neetcode.io/roadmap to work through some simple data structures and algorithms. While I took an algorithms course during my master's, it focused on proving the time complexity and correctness of algorithms, not the implementation of and operations you would perform on certain data structures. The class also covered common algorithms like breadth-first search and depth-first search, but the focus was on using them in pseudocode as part of proofs, not implementing them in actual code to solve hypothetical problems.

## Progress
###### 20240501
- Completed naive approach of O(n^2) on Level 1 - Problem 01 (Contains Duplicates) and learned how to perform unit tests in Python
- Completed solution to same problem using dictionary, but that only beats 11% of Python3 users

###### 20240502
- Found a solution very quickly for Level 1 - Problem 02 (Valid Anagram) that beats 58.57% of Python3 users on time.
- Learned how to read most optimal solutions and that the set function and counter functions are highly optimized.
