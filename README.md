# DSA
Showcases my work on learning data structures and algorithms

## The Plan
I will be using the roadmap provided on neetcode.io/roadmap to work through some simple data structures and algorithms. While I took an algorithms course during my master's, it focused on proving the time complexity and correctness of algorithms, not the implementation of and operations you would perform on certain data structures. The class also covered common algorithms like breadth-first search and depth-first search, but the focus was on using them in pseudocode as part of proofs, not implementing them in actual code to solve hypothetical problems.

## Progress
###### 20240501
- Completed naive approach of O(n^2) on Level 1 - Problem 01 (Contains Duplicates) and learned how to perform unit tests in Python
- Completed solution to same problem using dictionary, but that only beats 11% of Python3 users

###### 20240502
- Found a solution very quickly for Level 1 - Problem 02 (Valid Anagram) that beats 58.57% of Python3 users on time.
- Learned how to read most optimal solutions and that the set function and counter functions are highly optimized.

###### 20240520
- Found a solution very quickly for Level 1 - Problem 03 (Two Sum) that beats 85% of Python3 submissions on time. There were no clearly better answers.
- I was reminded to move a little bit slower if I don't want to have to debug the code. I referenced the integer I was looping with instead of the key of a dictionary that matched the integer.

###### 20240521
- I was unable to find a solution to Level 1 - Problem 04 (Group Anagrams) within an hour, so I analyzed the best Python3 solution.
- I learned a bit more about defaultdict and the intuition behind solving medium array and hashing problems.
- I very quickly found a solution to Level 1 - Problem 05 (Top K Frequent Elements), but I had to look up how to sort a defaultdict by values.

###### 20240523
- I learned a bit more about the possible answers to the Top K Frequent Elements problems, heaps, sorting algorithms, QuickSelect, and partitioning schemes by reading the editorial.
